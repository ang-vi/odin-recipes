    <h2>What is Arroz Chaufa?</h2>
    <p>Arroz chaufa, also known as arroz de chaufa (Chinese rice), is a fried rice dish from Peru. It is part of the Chinese Peruvian cuisine, which is called chifa.</p>
    <p>Arroz chaufa consists of a mix of fried rice with vegetables, usually including scallions, eggs, and chicken, quickly cooked at high heat, often in a wok with soy sauce and oil. It comes from the Chinese cuisine due to the influx of Chinese immigrants to Peru at the end of the 19th century.</p>
    <p>The meats typically used are usually pork, beef, chicken, and shrimp.[citation needed] Dark soy sauce is preferred for use with Peruvian fried rice.[citation needed] A person specialized in the art of making arroz chaufa is known as a chaufero.</p>
